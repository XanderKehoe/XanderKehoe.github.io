								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is Xander Kehoe. I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Tennessee - Chattanooga. Eager to learn anything and everything computer science related, currently very skilled in Java, C#, and Python. You can see some of <a href="#Projects">my projects here</a>.</p>
								<p>Since as far back as I can remember, I always wondered growing up how a computer worked down to every detail. When I around 11 years old, my best friend at the time convinced me to buy Minecraft. When playing, I discovered “Redstone” and its many mechanics. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was learning digital circuitry. When the game later released “Command Blocks” and I got around to learning those, I didn’t realize it but I was learning to think like a programmer.</p>
								<p>My love for video games prompted me to learn more about them, which always led to programming. I learned to create mods to enhance my gameplay experience, how to create scripts to automate my character’s movement and actions to perform grindy task overnight while I slept, played games that supported in-game programming to automate tasks and other ease of life functions, and eventually I learned how to make my own basic games.</p>
								<p>I later honed my skills when I finally got the Chattanooga State Community College and had my first real programming classes in Java. Once I got over an initial learning curve, I thoroughly enjoyed all my programming classes and always have looked forward to more.</p>
								<p>Although I don’t play video games nearly as much (probably for the better), my love for programming and desire to learn more about computer science/engineering remains. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Electric Turbine Design with Genetic Algorithm</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ElectricTurbineSolidWorks.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My friend Landon who is a Mechanical Engineering Major (with an Aerospace specialization) came to me asking for my help for a project he was working on. He was building a fixed-wing drone with VTOL capabilites, and needed to know the best parameters for his electric turbine engine such as diameter, the number of blades, and the angles of the blades at the root and at the tip to produce the maximum amount of thrust without exceeding a certain amount of torque. He knew of my expertise with genetic algorithms and asked if it was possible to help, and of course I did.</p>
								<p>We called over Discord and shared our screens and went to work. I described to him the process by which the algorithm works, and he walked me through how to perform all the math for calculating the thrust and torque given our parameters. The code got a lil messy in some places, but I cleaned it up quite a bit, and he has his own notes and he says he understands it, so thats good enough for me I suppose.</p>
								<p>The algorithm seemed to confirm some fairly obvious stuff such as maximizing the diameter and the size and number of blades will produce the most thrust, however the angles at the tip and end of the blades varied quite a bit depending on the other inputs. Landon wanted to adjust the range of the inputs quite a bit as he realized some of his initial range wasn't practical, which was very to switch out since the code was structured neatly and range of the parameters was easily set in a "Limits" class file.</p>
								<p>His initial goal was 2.5 lbs of force, and the algorithm was able to find a set of parameters that produced 2.99 lbs of force. Overall the algorithm was a huge success, he can easily switch out the parameters on his own to play around with.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Swarm A* Pathfinding</h2>
								<p>A modified A* pathfinding algorithm for a more erratic looking behavior. Utilizes multithreading and complex data structures to maximize performance. </p>
								<p>By utilizing a binary heap in our A* algorithm, running the pathfinding calculations on a seperate thread, and dividing the standard workload of all "seekers" across multiple threads, we can achieve extremely high performance.</p>
								<p>Further optimization for collision checking is developed by dividing the world into a grid, "seekers" will only test for collision with other seekers in their current grid chunk and the neighboring chunks. This skyrockets performance.</p>

								<h2 class="major">FlappyBird - GA</h2>
								<p>A loose recreation of Flappy Bird with a self-learning AI that teaches itself how to play the game.</p>
								<p>Created with: <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a></p>
								<p>This program uses a genetic algorithm and a simple neural network to teach itself how to play. The 'Birds' are initalized with a bunch of random weights in their network, they gain 'fitness' by staying alive and going through the pipes. Once all the Birds die, the genetic algorithm randomly (weighted) picks two of them based upon their fitness. Their weights are combined to make a new 'child', and this child's weights have a small chance of mutating slightly. This process is repeated until the new population is full, and then the new population replaces the old one, and the whole cycle repeats. The "Best Bird" (described below) is always added to each new population without any modification to its weights.</p>
								<p>The neural network class I designed for this project has no hidden nodes, and therefore consist simply of just an input layer and a single output node. The input layer consists of four inputs (position in x of Bird, position in y of Bird, position of closest pipe, y coordinate of the 'hole' in the closest pipe), and the output node determines if the Bird should jump.</p>
								<p>Training may takes just a couple mintues, or could take a couple of hours.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Climber - GA</h2>
								<p>A self-learning AI that teaches itself how to navigate a randomly generated complex environment quickly by utilizing multi-threading.</p>
								<p>Each of the agents that I call 'Climbers' have a simple goal, reach the blue box (the goal) at the top right side of the screen. They learn through the use of a Genetic Algorithm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">(More Information Here)</a>. However, all of these Climbers perform their calculations in the background on seperate threads, and only the 'Best Climber' (the climber with the highest recorded fitness) shown in purple is displayed in the program.</p>
								<p>The platforms (both stationary and moving) I refer to as 'obstacles'. The red obstacles are 'lava' obstacles, if a climber touches a lava obstacle more than once without touching a normal obstacle inbetween, it will die.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Neural Net Class - Python</h2>
								<p>Although there are many already out there, I wanted to create my own Neural Net class from scratch for learning sake. My class has the basic features of being able to feed forward and back propagate.</p>
								<p>I plan to make another version of this in the future. Although this works, I want to make a new version for two reasons:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>This version does not use matricies for computations, which would be a significant speed boost and make the code more readable. I didn't want to do at first due to fear that I might just end of copying/pasting other code while doing research, I figured this would be the best way to ensure I actually understand the concept.</li>
									<li>This version lacks support for biases</li>
								</ul>
								<p>I also added a function that takes a brute force approach to find the best neural net architecture for a given training set of data.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Economy Simulator</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/EconomySimData.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A barebones economy simulator that creates a complete economic cycle where people create businesses, businesses create products, people buy products, etc.</p>
								<p>By default, every person starts off with 30,000 "Kehoes" which is the currency in this simulated world. They are given a random "intelligence" level, higher intelligence people can work more complex jobs lower intelligence people cannot, thus allowing them more employment opportunities. People will seek the highest intelligence related jobs they can first, before looking at lower intelligence requiring jobs. There are other properties they are randomly given that effect when they'll switch jobs, and decision making in their businesses should they make one.</p>
								<p>Because actual human intuition is impossible to program, I have substituted it with random behavior. Every person has a 1/1000 chance of creating a business every day, unless they're already running a business. Every business owner will hire/fire employees and raise/lower cost of their product based upon their profits. When created, businesses create a random product of a random category. Categories are self explanatory, there are 4 built in categories, Food, Residence, Automobile, and Furniture, the last two options are pretty random I am aware. However, new categories can be created by a very small chance when a new business is created, this allows for a more arbitrary and general economic model.</p>
								<p>Each person will buy food and residence as needed, if they cannot find food or residence that they are satisfied with, they will pick the cheapest product they will find. After that, every person has a normally distributed random 'personal interest' in each category of products. Making some individuals more likely to buy certain products even if at a higher price. Ex. Some people really like cars, and will pay a lot more a higher quality automobile.</p>
								<p>Every product created by a business has the following properties: </p>
								<ul>
									<li>Required Production: How much work is required to create this product.</li>
									<li>Required Intelligence: What intelligence level is required in order for a person to create this product.</li>
									<li>Quality: An arbitrary value, people are more willing to buy products with higher quality, and in some cases, even at a higher price.</li>
									<li>Expiration: How many days the product will last.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Every business will list their inventory of products onto the "market", where consumers can compare and contrast their product with the product's of other businesses.</p>
								<p>The simulator tracks a variety of data such as unenployment rates, homelessness rates, starvation rates, quality of life, average extra spending money per person, and more is very easy to implement.  </p>

								<h3 class="major">Space Engineers - Spaceport Manager</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/SpacePort.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" /></span>
								<p>A Space Engineers Programmable Block Script for automated docking/undocking of ships with advanced features.</p>
								<p>From <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/">Space Engineers Official Steam Page</a>: "Space Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses, pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive." Space Engineers features a programmable block which offers opportunities for automation or ease of life task, which the script(s) here utilize to accomplish their task. These scripts are programmed in C#.</p>
								
								<h4 class="major">Overview & Features</h4>
								<p>This particular script allows ships to automatically dock themselves at a "Spaceport" without any assistance from the player. Ships and stations can connect (which allows for transfer of inventory, fuel, and power) if they both of a connector and have both connectors attempt a connection when they are within proximity of one another. The script allows the user to setup different "docking connector groups", this can be used if a user wants different hangers for different spacecraft (for example, military spacecraft can be reserved to one hanger, mining drones to another, and personal exploration ships to another). Sometimes these hangers are buried deep inside of a spacestation or ship with not so straight forward paths to reach them, so this script features "pathing" which allows spacecraft to wireless receive a queue of points to travel to first before attempting to dock (damaging crashes / hilarity would ensue without this).</p>
								<p>There is many features for adding connectors (with or without a specified group) and ensuring no duplicate ids occur, request to dock at a particular connector or connector group, if a request to dock at a specific connector group that is already full is received, wait until a connector from the group is free (placing the request into a 'Docking Que') and then send an update back to the request granting it permission to dock, also ensure only one ship is using a particular path at a time to avoid collisions, automated antenna management (only one message can be sent per ingame 'tick', if multiple are needed to be sent, then the rest of the messages are simply added to a 'Messague Que'). The most advanced feature (in my opinion), is that the spaceport is able to mobile, this means all stored coordinates for group pathing must be translated back and forth from relative to world coordinates with respect to both position and orientation, which takes a fair bit of math of accomplish.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Space Engineers - Laser Antenna Network</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/SE2.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A Space Engineers Programmable Block Script for intergrid communication using laser antennas.</p>
								<p>Intergrid communication can take place with normal antennas, however in doing so they transmit their location to not just you. Other players (who may not be so friendly) and hostile AI can see the location of the antenna if they are within range. For short range intergrid communcations, this is not an issue, however at medium-to-large ranges it is. Laser antennas allow for safe intergrid communcation, at the cost of complexity.</p>
								<p>This script allows the user to setup a laser antenna communication network, utilizing a single laser antenna at each station and connecting them to various 'hubs' throughout space, communication using laser antennas is made easy. We can either send messages to all stations (such as an alert if a station is under attack, and specifying which station it is), or just a single station (such as "Send ship x to these provided coordinates").</p>
								<p>This script is advanced and designed for use by myself and other scripters, and may be difficult to use for non-scripters.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Space Engineers - Dynamic Braking</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/SE3.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A Space Engineers Programmable Block Script for automated safe travelling between two points.</p>
								<p>In Space Engineers, there can be a lot of travelling from one asteroid or spacestation to the next. A regular annoyance with this task is that since the game is entirely physics based, you usually either A. stop/slow down too early and then have to keep inching your way towards your destination, or B. You attempt to slow down too late, resulting in potentially extremely dangerous crashes.</p>
								<p>Utilizing the camera block's raycast functionality, we can input our position in space, the position of where were we want to go, the ship's mass, and the amount of thrust (in force (N)) pointed backwards; and using vector analysis and basic physics, we can calculate exactly when the ship should start slowing down. Saving time without compromising safety.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Two Player Snake</h3>
								<p>The original snake game recreated in Java, but with two players! This was my final project in my game design class, everyone (including our Professor) played each other's final projects during our "final exam", and the class voted my game 2nd best out of all! Very simple process turned fun.</p>

								<h3>The Math & Code</h3>
								<p>Once the user points the camera block at the desired travel location, the script will raycast from the camera to return the first object it hits (usually an asteroid or spacestation). We use this object's coordinate to create a unit vector, the first step is the denominator of the dot product for each of the x, y, and z planes:</p>
								<pre><code>double denominator = Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(coordinate.X - currentCoords.X, 2)
	+ Math.Pow(coordinate.Y - currentCoords.Y, 2)
	+ Math.Pow(coordinate.Z - currentCoords.Z, 2));
double xMultiplier = (coordinate.X - currentCoords.X) / denominator;
double yMultiplier = (coordinate.Y - currentCoords.Y) / denominator;
double zMultiplier = (coordinate.Z - currentCoords.Z) / denominator;</code></pre>
								<p>Adjust our target coordinates to offset towards the ship:</p>
								<pre><code>coordinate.X -= finalDistFromTarget * xMultiplier;
coordinate.Y -= finalDistFromTarget * yMultiplier;
coordinate.Z -= finalDistFromTarget * zMultiplier;</code></pre>
								<p>Calculate how much force we can generate from our backwards facing thrusters, and use it to calculate our needed breaking distance</p>
								<pre><code>//Setting up backward thrusters list
backwardThrusters = new List<IMyThrust>();

//Obtaining each thruster pointing backward
foreach (IMyThrust thruster in thrusters)
	if (Base6Directions.GetFlippedDirection(rc.Orientation.Forward) == Base6Directions.GetFlippedDirection(thruster.Orientation.Forward))
		backwardThrusters.Add(thruster);

//Obtaining max backward acceleration
MyShipMass myShipMass = rc.CalculateShipMass();
backwardsAcceleration = CalculateAcceleration(myShipMass.TotalMass, backwardThrusters);</code></pre>
								<p>Finally we set up our autopilot:</p>
								<pre><code>rc.ClearWaypoints();
rc.AddWaypoint(coordinate, "AUTO DYNAMIC BRAKING SCRIPT COORDINATE");
rc.SetAutoPilotEnabled(true);
rc.SetCollisionAvoidance(false);
rc.SetDockingMode(false);
rc.FlightMode = FlightMode.OneWay;
rc.Direction = Base6Directions.Direction.Forward;</code></pre>

								<h4 class="major">The Math for Docking</h4>
								<p>In order to perform automated docking, we first need to find the coordinates where to send our ship. This is accomplished simply taking our docking connector's world coordinates and adding some multiple of its facing unit vector.</p>
								<p>Once the ship has reached its assigned destination, we use linear algebra to adjust the ship's gyroscopes to point the ship in the same direction as our docking connector:</p>
								<pre><code>void ApplyGyroOverride(double pitch_speed, double yaw_speed, double roll_speed, List<IMyGyro> gyro_list, IMyTerminalBlock reference)
{
	var rotationVec = new Vector3D(-pitch_speed, yaw_speed, roll_speed); //because keen does some weird stuff with signs
	var shipMatrix = reference.WorldMatrix;
	var relativeRotationVec = Vector3D.TransformNormal(rotationVec, shipMatrix);
	foreach (var thisGyro in gyro_list)
	{
		var gyroMatrix = thisGyro.WorldMatrix;
		var transformedRotationVec = Vector3D.TransformNormal(relativeRotationVec, Matrix.Transpose(gyroMatrix));
		thisGyro.Pitch = (float)transformedRotationVec.X;
		thisGyro.Yaw = (float)transformedRotationVec.Y;
		thisGyro.Roll = (float)transformedRotationVec.Z;
		thisGyro.GyroOverride = true;
	}
}</code></pre>
								<p>We test for proper alignment by:</p>
								<pre><code>void GetRotationAngles(Vector3D targetVector, IMyTerminalBlock reference, out double yaw, out double pitch)
{
	var localTargetVector = Vector3D.TransformNormal(targetVector, MatrixD.Transpose(reference.WorldMatrix));
	var flattenedTargetVector = new Vector3D(localTargetVector.X, 0, localTargetVector.Z);

	yaw = VectorAngleBetween(Vector3D.Forward, flattenedTargetVector) * Math.Sign(localTargetVector.X); //right is positive
	if (Math.Abs(yaw) < 1E-6 && localTargetVector.Z > 0) //check for straight back case
		yaw = Math.PI;

	if (Vector3D.IsZero(flattenedTargetVector)) //check for straight up case
		pitch = MathHelper.PiOver2 * Math.Sign(localTargetVector.Y);
	else
		pitch = VectorAngleBetween(localTargetVector, flattenedTargetVector) * Math.Sign(localTargetVector.Y); //up is positive
}</code></pre>
								<p>If the values returned are very small ( > .01), then we find the closest point on the docking connector's unit vector from our ship using the dot product</p>
								<pre><code>public double DistanceFromVector(Vector3D origin, Vector3D direction, Vector3D currentPos, out Vector3D closestPoint)
{
	direction.Normalize();
	Vector3D lhs = currentPos - origin;

	double dotP = lhs.Dot(direction);
	closestPoint = origin + direction * dotP;
	return Vector3D.Distance(currentPos, closestPoint);
}</code></pre>
								<p>If this returned distance is greather than 0.35m. We run into through a function that takes in each thruster group's facing unit vector to determine which thrusters need to be activated:</p>
								<pre><code>leftDir = leftThrusterGroup.First().WorldMatrix.Forward;
rightDir = rightThrusterGroup.First().WorldMatrix.Forward;
upDir = upThrusterGroup.First().WorldMatrix.Forward;
downDir = downThrusterGroup.First().WorldMatrix.Forward;

Echo("Distance From Docking Vector: " + distanceFromVectorPoint);

double leftDot = leftDir.Dot(closestPoint);
double rightDot = rightDir.Dot(closestPoint);
double upDot = upDir.Dot(closestPoint);
double downDot = downDir.Dot(closestPoint);

if (leftDot < rightDot)
	if (Math.Abs(leftDot) > 0.1)
		ApplyProperThrust(leftThrusterGroup, rightThrusterGroup, leftDir, leftDot, closestPoint, distanceFromVectorPoint);
else
	if (Math.Abs(rightDot) > 0.1)
		ApplyProperThrust(rightThrusterGroup, leftThrusterGroup, rightDir, rightDot, closestPoint, distanceFromVectorPoint);

if (upDot < downDot)
	if (Math.Abs(upDot) > 0.1)
		ApplyProperThrust(upThrusterGroup, downThrusterGroup, upDir, upDot, closestPoint, distanceFromVectorPoint);

else
	if (Math.Abs(downDot) > 0.1)
		ApplyProperThrust(downThrusterGroup, upThrusterGroup, downDir, downDot, closestPoint, distanceFromVectorPoint);</code></pre>
								<p>We repeat our previous distance test and repeat this process until the returned distance is less than (or equal to) to 0.35m. Once this condition is satisifed, we activate the backward facing thrusters and slowly move the ship backward into position. We test for connectability by<pre><code> if (connector.Status == MyShipConnectorStatus.Connectable)
	connector.Connect()</code></pre></p>

								<h4 class="major">Intergrid Communication</h4>
								<p>Intergrid communciation between the ship is accomplished via the game's antenna block <code>antenna.TransmitMessage(String str)</code>. This method of communication is known as message passing, which means once we transmit our data we have to be able to parse through it. The simplified code for this looks like:</p>
								<pre><code>if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(argument)) {
	Echo("Argument: " + argument);
	string[] info = argument.Split(new string[] { "," }, StringSplitOptions.None);
	if (info[0].ToLower() == "dock"){
		dockingConnectorPos = Vector3D.tryParse(info[1])
		//perform docking
	}
	else if (info[1].ToLower() == "wait"){
		//tell the ship thats it's docking request was received
		//and wait for further instructions
	}	
	else if (info[1].ToLower() == "stop"){
		//tell the ship to perform an emergency stop
	}	
}</code></pre>
								<p>The script was designed to handle multiple ships supporting multiple 'hangers'. Some sometimes ship's must wait for another ship to finish docking before it can safely dock itself, once it is safe to dock, an update is broadcasted with the antenna to notify the ship that it is it's turn to dock.</p>
